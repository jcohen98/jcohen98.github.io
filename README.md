# Joshua Gabriel Cohen's Personal Website

A portfolio website to provide as an archive and display of past and current projects I have been engaged in, starting from my Freshman year at Drexel University. This portfolio is not necesarilly comprehensive, and highlights key projects and work that are either important to me or important in their own respect.

This website has been edited from a free bootstrap template from folio. All acknowledgements have been left intact on the website footer.
